- Jan 1990 to Jan 2023: $100 is $234.83

[St Louis FRED Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA#)

<br>

First, let's adjust the earnings for inflation since 1990. 

- Per the BLS CPI calculator we can estimate the cumulative increase as 134.83%

<br>

To keep things more interesting for us today let's update the earnings in the survey for inflation.

- Make a new column, earnk_adj

- Multiply the amount by 1 +the rate of inflation

- The value of that column is the current earnk * 2.3483

- Note: Each time you copy this new variable to a new working sheet you have to paste special as a number.

Ordinary least squares minimizes the squared residuals.

Think of it like an iterative process.

1. Draw a line through the data points.

2. Calculate the residual for every data point 
    - The residual is the distance between the model line and the actual values in the data.

3. Square the residuals and add them together

4. Record the result and start over with a new line.

5. Finally, you keep the line with the smallest sum of squared residuals.

<br>

### Why square the residuals before adding them together?
- (Don't want the positive and negative errors to cancel each other out!)

<br>

In reality, the software uses matrix algebra to solve for the line which is much faster.

We'll discuss most of the output here, but keep yourself rooted in our work so far on the formula for a line.

All of this detail is provided to allow us to estimate the formula for the OLS line and to evaluate how well the line fits the actual data.

- The intercept "coefficient" is the alpha (e.g. the constant)

- The height "coefficient" is the beta coefficient in the formula for a line

<br>

Quick tangent: The Excel regression output is... let's just identify it as non-standard.

- Never provide someone with the raw Excel output if they ask you for a regression analysis. It looks terrible and is rather hard to disentangle.

```
]

???

In most published work with regression results you'll see a table that looks something like this.

- The first section, with the variable names, lists the elements you need to draw the OLS line (e.g. use the formula of a line)
    - Each coefficient is the number we plug into the formula for this line
    - The standard errors below each coefficient are a measure of how "good" your estimate is.
    - The stars represent a shorthand way of saying the fit is "good" or not
    
So, this OLS table describes a line where yearly earnings = -31

- The bottom section provides the info we need to evaluate the fit of the model as a whole
    - The number of observations, R^2, residual error and various tests of model fit like the F statistic.

We'll talk through each of these in a moment.

### Does everybody understand how the OLS line attempts to summarize the relationship between these two variables?

We can plug any height value in and the line gives us a prediction of weight based on the data we have.

### Any questions on how to extract the formula for a line from the OLS regression and then to use it to make predictions?

Here is the histogram of heights in the dataset.

We just made a point estimate (prediction) based on the mean value (66.6).
- That's typically the first place everybody begins making predictions.

- Pretty clearly here that represents the most common height value in the data so seeing what our model predicts for it makes sense

<br>

Our next task is to use our model to evaluate how changes in the predictor translate to changes in the outcome.

Ok, use our model to make these two predictions.

A second option is to make two point predictions on a narrower slice of the data.

The standard deviation tells you how far from the mean the values in any list of numbers are on average.

- If the mean is the "correct" answer, the sd tells you how far off these numbers tend to be.

<br>

Here we see two histograms of different lists of numbers.

- In both lists, the mean is the most common value but the rest of the numbers are spread around it.

- On the left we see a distribution with a large standard deviation
    - A big sd means the numbers are very spread out and any single number you select from the list may be very far from the mean

- On the right we see a distribution with a small standard deviation
    - A small sd means any single number in the list is likely close to the mean.

???

The standard error works like this for the regression estimates.

- Here we see the education beta estimate at 5.57 with a large and a small standard error.

- Technically, the standard error is an estimate of the standard deviation of the coefficient.

- In other words, the SE describes how much we'd expect the coefficient estimate to change if we re-ran our analysis on new data for our sample using this same model.
    - e.g. ran a new nationally representative survey of Americans and asked them about their earnings and education. 

- Just as before, large SEs mean we should not be confident because any new replication of this model and analysis will produce estimates that may be very far away from our current one.

- Small SEs mean we are confident that our estimated coefficient is closer to the 'true' parameter value and that new replications will reinforce our confidence.

Our actual estimated SE is tiny!
- These histograms use the SE to simulate our whole analysis 5,000 times.

### What do we notice when comparing these two histograms? Perhaps something related to the null hypothesis?

### Focusing just on the histogram that uses our actual SE, what can we say about the education coefficient across all 5,000 simulations?
- (Basically every single simulation produced an estimate of the coefficient between 4.5 and 6.5!)
    - We should feel super confident about our estimate!
    
### And what do we learn from the 5,000 simulations with the large SE?
- (Results show a HUGE range; estimates vary from -10 to above 20!)
- (AND a bunch of the estimates are 0, e.g. the null hypothesis!)
- (AND a bunch of results are NEGATIVE meaning more education lowers your earnings!)

### Does this make sense? Any questions on how to interpret the SE?

**SLIDE:** Now, with an estimate of the coefficient and a measure of the error we can try to measure the probability that our alternative hypothesis beats the null hypothesis.

???

The t-statistic gives us a statistical method for determining if our model estimates are likely to be significant, rather than having to visualize thousands of simulations.

- Calculated by dividing the estimated coefficient by the standard error

<br>

This converts our estimates into a new number, called a t-statistic, which represents the number of error units between zero (the null hypothesis) and our estimate (the alternative hypothesis).

```

???

It turns out that t-scores can be evaluated using the Student's t-distribution which is approximately normal in shape and can be estimated using degrees of freedom when you don't know the actual underlying standard deviation.

- Here we see a density curve of the Student's t with 1800 degrees of freedom (approximately the size of our survey sample).

- Think of this like a histogram but instead of counting bins it represents probabilities.

- The entire area under the curve equals 100% of all possible coefficient estimates.

<br>

We can use this distribution to evaluate our model's t-statistic and it will tell us how likely we are to get our results IF THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE.

```

???

The Student's t allows us to make projections based on a world where the null hypothesis is true.

<br>

For example, let's say we could re-run our survey 1000 times with 1000 different samples.

- The t distribution tells us that in half of the new surveys the coefficient on education would have a t-statistic between -.67 and +.67.

- In other words, assuming the null is true and education has ZERO effect on earnings we would expect to find half of our surveys give results in this blue area.
    - This blue area, therefore, represents results mostly indistinguishable from zero.

  annotate("text", x = -1.5, y = .025, label = "-1.15")
```

???

Let's say we want to be more careful than that, so we bump it to 75%

- Here we see that 75% of the new surveys would produce education t-stats between -1.15 and 1.15.

- So, a result above or below those numbers would be different than 75% of the null results.

  annotate("text", x = 2.2, y = .1, label = "+1.96") +
  annotate("text", x = -2.2, y = .1, label = "-1.96")
```

???

So, we run 1,000 new analyses using our current research plan and we would expect 95% of the education t-stats to be between -2 and 2 ASSUMING THE NULL HYPOTHESIS IS TRUE.

- In other words, assuming a null hypothesis world you should almost never see a t-score on education above 2!

### And what is the t-stat we estimated in our regression?

  geom_vline(xintercept = 15.4, color = "blue", lwd = 1.25)
```

???

And this is the intuition behind the check for statistical significance.

<br>

Typically we assume that t-statistics above 2 or below -2 are far enough away from zero to be meaningful (e.g. "statistically significant").

- In other words, estimates that are at least two error units away from zero are probably pretty good.

<br>

In our education example we see our coefficient estimate is 15 SE units away from zero.

- That's a long, long way out there!

**SLIDE**: Of course, nobody really communicates in SE units, so let's convert those into probabilities!

.size55[**Converts the t-stat into a probability**]]

???

In our visualizations we kept increasing the spread of our experiment from 50% to 75% to 95%.

The p-value in an OLS regression table is presented in the other direction, e.g. 1 - this %.
- In other words, the smaller the p-value the better

- So, giving the null hypothesis a 95% chance of winning is 1 - .95 = 0.05, e.g. a 5% test.

- Excel here is rounding to 2 digits. I have an estimate of something like 2e-16

### Make sense?

<br>

Key takeaway: Researchers have come to accept that any p-value smaller than 5% (0.05) is "statistically significant."

- p-values smaller than 0.05 means your alternative hypothesis "wins" (e.g. fits the data better than the null). 

- p-values larger than 0.05 means the null "wins"  (e.g. fits the data better than the alternative).

### So, which wins for our education coefficient?
- (Here we see a p-value on education of 4x10-50. That's an **incredibly** tiny number.)
    - In other words, if reality is that education has ZERO effect on earnings we would ALMOST NEVER expect to find an effect as large as 5.57

### What questions do you have about this chain of steps that start with a coefficient and end with a probability?

Let's put it all together.

Here are the Excel and the scatter plot.

- These p-values are both below 0.05 so we say that the blue line fits the data better than the red line.

- The star indicates a p-value smaller than some threshold. 

- In this table the note identifies 0.05.

<br>

So, when formatting a regression table the expectation is that you will include stars next to "significant" coefficients

- You should also include a note at the bottom as to what your chosen level of significance is.

### Questions on this?

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,2), labels = c("Smoker", "Non-Smoker"), limits = c(0.75,2.25))
```

???

In terms of the regression output you can see that the p-value on smoking is .19 which is bigger than 0.05.

- So, even though the coefficient is almost 3, meaning non-smokers earn 3k more on average, we are not confident the model is an improvement on the null hypothesis.

Super important note: Small R squared values do not mean bad models!

- It does mean overall predictions are likely to be off, but the slope of the line might still be highly precise!

In other words, I am confident that people with more education will earn more on average, BUT I'm not super confident that this model will accurately pinpoint the exact right salary.

Step 4 is where I ask you to do something different than the textbook's approach.

- The book's authors are focused on a very narrow type of error that is likely when you have time series data.

<br>

I prefer that we develop and apply a different tool, a residuals plot, that is helpful regardless of the kind of data you are working with.

In this plot the y-axis represents the residuals of the model and the x-axis the predicted values of the model.

- By residuals, we mean the difference between the actual data and the model.

- By predicted values, we mean the points along the model line.

<br>

This will be clearer when we make them in a moment, but first let's talk about the goal.

- This example is what we're hoping to see.

- The points are scattered above and below the horizontal line at zero in a seemingly random pattern.

- This is what we call homoscedastic errors.

background-image: url('libs/Images/Session2-Bad_Residuals1.png')
background-size: 100%

???

The first type of problem a residual plot can identify for you is evidence of heteroskedasticity.

<br>

This slide shows two models fit to data.

On the left, the model shows homoscedastic errors, meaning it is about equally accurate anywhere along the line.
- That's the goal!

- This model makes predictions all along the line with about the same level of error at each point.
    
<br>
    
On the right, the model shows heteroskedastic errors and they indicate something is wrong with our model.

- In our example on the right, our model makes much more accurate predictions at the low end and MUCH more inaccurate predictions at the high end.

- This is evidence that our model is missing something at the high end and may be over-fitting to the data on the low end.

<br>

The goal is a model line that goes through the conditional means of the data so a good fitting model should have similar levels of error all the way along it.

- Otherwise, our assumption that the model is a straight line may be wrong.
